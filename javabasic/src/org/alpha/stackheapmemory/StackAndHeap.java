//Difference between Stack and Heap
/*
-> Stack memory is used for storing local variables and function calls and has a fix size.
It is fast and efficient, but can only be used for storing short-live data.

-> Heap memory is used for storing objects and class instance (instance variables)
and it dynamically allocated at runtime. It slower and less efficient but can
be used for storing long lived data and is shared among all threads in a program.
